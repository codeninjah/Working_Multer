# Express JS using multer for file upload

This project let's users upload files that are images or videos up to 250MB.
They can thereafter view the uploaded files by using the /gallery endpoint
Or they can either view the /photos or the /videos
I also added a functionality to shuffle the files before they are viewed, so gallery will random the order of the files when you view it
You upload files by using the /upload endpoint

`npm install` and `node app.js` and that's it!
